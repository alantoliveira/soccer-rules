== Technical Specification For Soccer Field

[[dimensions-of-the-field]]
=== Dimensions of the field

The playing field is 158 cm by 219 cm. The field is
marked by a white line which is part of the playing field. Around the
playing field, beyond the white line, there is an outer area
of 12 cm in width.

The floor near the exterior wall includes a wedge, which is an incline with a
10 cm base and 2 +/- 1 cm rise for allowing the ball to roll back into play
when it leaves the playing field. Note that the goal should not contain the
wedge.

Total dimensions of the field, including the outer area, are 182 cm by 243 cm.

[[field-walls]]
=== Walls

Walls are placed all around the field, including behind the goals and the
out-area. The height of the walls is 22 cm. The walls are painted matte black.

[[goals]]
=== Goals

The field has two goals, centered on each of the shorter sides of the playing
field. The goal inner space is 60 cm wide, 10 cm high and 74 mm deep, box
shaped.

The goal "posts" are positioned over the white line marking the limits of the
field.

The interior walls and of each goal are colored matte, one goal yellow and the
other goal blue. It is recommended that the blue be of a brighter shade so that
it is different enough from the black exterior.

[[floor]]
=== Floor

The floor
consists of green carpet ideally of darker shade on top of a hard level surface. Teams
should be prepared to adjust to different levels of contrast between the green carpet
and lines as some events may be restricted to using lighter shades of green. All
lines on the field should be painted, marked with tape,
or installed as white carpet and be somewhat resistant to tearing or ripping.
Lines should have a width of 20mm (±10%).

It is impractical to set international constraints on carpet other than it
being green. In the spirit of the competition, teams should design robots
to be tolerant or adaptable to different fibers, textures, construction,
density, shades, and designs of carpet especially when competing amongst different
regions. Teams are encouraged to visit regional resources or reach out to Local
Organization Committee for suggestions if desiring to build their own practice
field(s).

[[neutral-spots]]
=== Neutral spots

There are five neutral spots defined in the field. One is in the center of the
field. The other four are adjacent to each corner, located 45 cm
along the long edge of the field. They align with the sides of the penalty
areas. The neutral spots can be drawn with a thin black marker.
The neutral spots ought to be of circular shape measuring 1 cm in diameter.

[[center-circle]]
=== Center circle

A center circle will be drawn on the field. It is 60 cm in diameter. It is a
thin black marker line. It is there as guidance during kick-off.

[[penalty-areas]]
=== Penalty areas

In front of each goal there is a 25 cm wide and 80 cm long penalty
area with rounded front corners (15cm radius).

The penalty areas are marked by a white line of 20 mm (±10%) width. The
line is part of the area.

[[lighting-and-magnetic-conditions]]
=== Lighting and Magnetic Conditions

The tournament organizers will do their best to limit the amount of external lightning and
magnetic interference. However, the robots need to be constructed in a way
which allows them to work in conditions that are not perfect (i.e. by not
relying on compass sensors or specific lightning conditions).

This document contains specifications for the passive ball (Open League, 
orange golf ball), the large infrared ball (LightWeight and Entry League).

[[technical-specification-for-pulsed-soccer-ball]]
== Technical Specification for pulsed Soccer Ball

[[pulsed-preamble]]
=== Preamble

Answering to the request for a soccer ball for RCJ tournaments that would be
more robust to interfering lights, less energy consuming and mechanically more
resistant, the Soccer League Committee defined the following technical
specifications with the special collaboration from EK Japan and HiTechnic.

Producers of these balls must apply for a certification process upon which they
can exhibit the RCJ-compliant label and their balls used in RCJ tournaments.

Balls with these specifications can be detected using specific sensors but
also common IR remote control receivers (TSOP1140, TSOP31140, GP1UX511QS,
etc. - on-off detection with a possible gross indication of distance).

[[pulsed-golf-2026]]
=== Switch to golf-ball sized pulsed ball in 2026
Starting in 2026, Lightweight Soccer will be moving to a new IR Ball. The key
difference with this ball is the size change from 74mm to 42mm diameter,
which is the same size as the Open League's passive ball. More information
will be released during the 2025 season by the Committee. This ball is
Open-Source, so anyone can produce one from the files & instructions on the
GitHub Page here: https://github.com/robocup-junior/ir-golf-ball . 

Entry Leagues will continue to use the large infrared ball.
footnote:[Entry Leagues frequently use Lego, FischerTechnik, Vex or other
robotics kits with which handling a small ball is more difficult, especially
for beginners.]

[[pulsed-specifications]]
=== Specifications

[[ir-light]]
==== IR light

The ball emits infra-red (IR) light of wavelengths in the range 920nm - 960nm,
pulsed at a square-wave carrier frequency of 40 kHz. The ball should have
enough ultra-bright, wide-angle LEDs to minimize unevenness of the IR output.

[[pulsed-diameter]]
==== Diameter

The diameter of the ball is required to be 74mm. A well-balanced ball shall be
used.

[[pulsed-drop-test]]
==== Drop Test

The ball must be able to resist normal gameplay. As an indication of its
durability, it should be able to survive, undamaged, a free-fall from 1.5
meters onto a hardwood table or floor.

[[pulsed-modulation]]
==== Modulation

The 40 kHz carrier output of the ball shall be modulated with a trapezoidal
(stepped) waveform of frequency 1.2 kHz. Each 833-microsecond cycle of the
modulation waveform shall comprise 8 carrier pulses at full intensity, followed
(in turn) by 4 carrier pulses at 1/4 of full intensity, four pulses at 1/16 of
full intensity and four pulses at 1/64 of full intensity, followed by a space
(i.e. zero intensity) of about 346 microseconds. The peak current level in the
LEDs shall be within the range 45-55mA. The radiant intensity shall be more
than 20mW/sr per LED.

[[pulsed-battery-life]]
==== Battery Life

If the ball has an embedded rechargeable battery, when new and fully charged it
should last for more than 3 hours of continuous use before the brightness of
the LEDs drops to 90% of the initial value. If the ball uses replaceable
batteries, a set of new high-quality alkaline batteries should last for more
than 8 hours of continuous use before the brightness of the LEDs drops to 90%
of the initial value.

[[pulsed-coloration]]
==== Coloration

The ball must not have any marks or discoloration that can be confused with
goals, or the field itself.

[[official-suppliers-for-pulsed-balls]]
=== Official suppliers for pulsed balls

Currently, there is one ball that has been approved by the
Soccer League Committee:

- RoboCup Junior Soccer ball operating in MODE A (pulsed) made by EK Japan/Elekit (https://elekit.co.jp/en/product/RCJ-05R)

Note that this ball was previously called RCJ-05. While you may not be able to
find a ball with this name anymore, any IR ball produced by EK Japan/Elekit is
considered to be approved by the Soccer League Committee.

[appendix]
[[passive-ball-spec]]
== Technical Specification for passive Soccer Ball

[[passive-ball-spec-preamble]]
=== Preamble

In order to push the state of the art in the Soccer competition forward,
while also trying to bridge the gap between the Junior and Major leagues, the
Soccer League Committee chose a standard orange golf ball as the "passive" ball.
This is the same choice as the Small Size League makes footnote:[See the SSL
rules at https://robocup-ssl.github.io/ssl-rules/sslrules.html#_ball] and since
these balls are standardized, they should be cheap and easy to get anywhere
around the globe.

[[specifications]]
=== Specifications

[[passive-diameter]]
==== Diameter

The diameter of the ball is required to be 42mm +- 1mm.

[[passive-drop-test]]
==== Drop Test

The ball must be able to resist normal gameplay. As an indication of its
durability, it should be able to survive, undamaged, a free-fall from 1.5
meters onto a hardwood table or floor.

[[passive-coloration]]
==== Coloration

The ball shall be of orange color. Since the definition of the orange color in
general is not easy, any color that a human would deem to be orange and is
substantially different from the other colors used on the field is acceptable.
While tournament organizers may supply matte balls to improve camera vision,
teams must still be prepared to play with the balls supplied by
tournament organizers.

[[passive-surface]]
==== Surface

Engravings and printed labels on the ballâ€™s surface are tolerated.
The the ball should not have
a soft-touch finish. Teams must be prepared to play with balls as supplied
by tournament organizers.

[[passive-weight]]
==== Weight

The weight of the ball should be 46 grams (+- 1 gram).
